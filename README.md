Adios rdio, it's been real: Migrate rdio data to spotify.

Licensed under GPLv3.

Note: work has been halted since the introduction of rdio's own exporting service via rdio.com/farewell and an official importing tool for this data for Spotify. rdio went offline on Dec. 22 2015. Thanks rdio, it's been real.

The most reusable work I've done here is getting OAuth 2.0 to work for rdio/Spotify. Feel free to use and take what you wish!
